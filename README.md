# ðŸš— Dynamic Pricing for Urban Parking Lots

Capstone Project for **Summer Analytics 2025**  
Organized by: Consulting & Analytics Club Ã— Pathway

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
Urban parking spaces are often underpriced or overpriced due to static pricing. This leads to either overcrowding or underutilization. This project simulates a **real-time dynamic pricing system** for 14 urban parking lots using economic principles and data-driven modeling.

We implement **three progressively intelligent pricing models** using Python, Pandas, NumPy, and Pathway â€” and visualize them in real time using Bokeh.

## ðŸ§  Project Objectives
- Design a dynamic pricing engine that:
  - Adapts in real time
  - Responds to demand, congestion, queue length, and nearby competitor prices
  - Suggests intelligent pricing while avoiding erratic fluctuations
- Build 3 models:
  - Baseline (linear)
  - Demand-based (multi-feature)
  - Competitive (geospatial + pricing awareness)
- Simulate real-time pipeline using Pathway
- Visualize prices using interactive Bokeh plots

 Model 1: Baseline Linear Pricing
A simple model where price increases with occupancy.
Formula:
Price = BasePrice + Î± Ã— (Occupancy / Capacity)
Base Price = $10
Î± = Scaling factor (e.g., 5.0)

Model 2: Demand-Based Pricing
Uses a weighted demand function based on:
-Occupancy ratio
-Queue length
-Traffic condition
-Special day flag
-Vehicle type (car/bike/truck)

Formula:
Price = BasePrice Ã— (1 + Î» Ã— NormalizedDemand)
Where NormalizedDemand is scaled between 0 and 1

Capped to:
Minimum = 0.5 Ã— base
Maximum = 2 Ã— base

Model 3: Competitive Pricing (Optional + Rewarded)
Adds intelligence by comparing each lot to nearby lots within 1 km.
Logic:

If nearby lots are cheaper â†’ reduce price slightly
If nearby lots are expensive/full â†’ increase price
Distance calculated using: Haversine formula

ðŸ“ˆ Visualizations
All models include Bokeh plots showing real-time pricing trends per lot.
Interactive charts allow users to hover and compare across timestamps.
